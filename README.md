## Note
The distro is technically in an operational state, but it's not currently possible to confirm without burning arkanaOS to a DVD.

## Cloning and Building
To build the project, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkana-team/arkanaOS.git
cd arkanaOS
sudo make
```

You need to use `sudo` to build arkanaOS successfully.
